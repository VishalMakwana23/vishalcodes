            <p>
              With over 2+ years of dedicated experience in web design and
              development, I bring a wealth of expertise to craft exceptional
              digital solutions. Proficient in both front-end and back-end
              development, I am dedicated to delivering results that exceed
              expectations. I have developed several web applications from
              scratch but at the same time, I manage and update the clientâ€™s
              existing projects also as I have outstanding debugging skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm very proficient in working with the following technologies:

            <ul className="art-custom-list">
              <li>React JS</li>

              <li>GraphQL</li>
              <li>JavaScript</li>
              <li>Express.js</li>
              <li>React Native</li>
              <li>Rest APIs</li>
              <li>Test Driver Development</li>
              <li>Node.js</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I have been creating JavaScript apps for the last 2+ years: my
              main focus is web development using React.js, Next.js, and
              Node.js, I have a strong background in front-end design and
              development, and happily work in SASS, HTML5, JavaScript, and
              React to create websites that work beautifully for everyone.
